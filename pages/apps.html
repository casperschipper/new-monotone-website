	<h1> Thijs Geritz Portifolio App: TGGD+</h1>
	The portfolio app we made for graphic designer Thijs Geritz is finally finished and available at the app store. It has been a long development, almost all the user interface elements had to be customized or even completely written from scratch. However we think the end result feels really smooth and intuitive in terms of navigation. Also a lot of time was invested in making all the content dynamic. This means that Thijs could upload his own content through a content management system online. For this we used Drupal, which we experienced as a very flexible environment. iOS however is still a bit sturdy when it comes to dynamic data like JSON.</P>
