		<h1>How we work</h>
		<h3>Holistic</h3>
		<p>We believe in interdisciplinary and global approaches to design. By doing a sharp and precise analysis of the final goals and strategies, we can reflect on the best way to design, engineer and market a product.</p>

		<h3>Agile prototyping</h3>
		<p>Early stages of a product development require the freedom to explore possibilities. Fast prototyping and continuous iteration may assure the success of the final product.</p>

		<h3>Sustainable implementation</h3>
		<p>In order to extend, update and enrich the life cycle of a product, sustainability is fundamental. We like to implement technology in a way that future iterations can integrate new components, updates and  improvements easily.</p>
		
		<h3>Open communication</h3>
		<p>We love sharing our insights with our clients concerning aesthetics, usability and responsiveness. Sometimes the smallest idea can change the way we perceive technology, trends or business opportunities.</p>
